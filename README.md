# SQL_PROJECT-customer_orders_product-

Database Structure:
Tables:

You have three tables: Customers, Orders, and Products.
The Customers table stores information about customers.
The Orders table stores information about orders, including product details and order dates.
The Products table contains information about different products.
Primary Keys:

Each table has a primary key (CustomerID for Customers, OrderID for Orders, and ProductID for Products), ensuring data uniqueness.
Relationships:

There are relationships established between tables using foreign keys (CustomerID in Orders and ProductName in Products).
Data Analysis:
Customer Insights:

Queries such as SELECT * FROM Customers provide a view of the customer data.
Filtering customers whose names start with 'J' using WHERE Name LIKE 'J%'.
Order and Product Information:

Retrieving details about orders (SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM Orders).
Aggregating total quantity across all orders (SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity FROM Orders).
Joins and Combinations:

Joining tables to combine data, such as SELECT Name FROM Customers AS C JOIN Orders AS O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID.
Product Price Analysis:

Filtering products with prices greater than $10 (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Price > 10.00).
Calculating the average price of products (SELECT AVG(Price) AS AVGPrice FROM Products).
Grouping and Aggregation:

Grouping orders by customer name and calculating the sum of quantities (SELECT C.Name AS CustomerName, SUM(O.Quantity) FROM Customers AS C JOIN Orders AS O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID GROUP BY C.Name).
Data Discrepancies:

Identifying records where there is no corresponding order in the Orders table (LEFT JOIN and WHERE O.OrderID IS NULL).
Advanced Analysis:
Top Customers:

Identifying top customers based on the total quantity ordered (SELECT TOP 5 C.Name AS CustomerName, SUM(O.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity FROM Customers AS C JOIN Orders AS O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID GROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.Name ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC).
Data Modification:

Altering the structure of the Products table by adding a new column (ALTER TABLE Products ADD Category VARCHAR(50)).
Category Analysis:

Analyzing product categories and calculating the average price per category (SELECT Category, AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice FROM Products GROUP BY Category).
Suggestions:
Consistency:

Ensure consistency in naming conventions and data types across tables.
Indexing:

Consider adding indexes to columns frequently used in joins or where conditions for improved query performance.
Visualization:

Consider using visualization tools like Power BI to present the insights derived from your SQL queries in a more user-friendly and intuitive way.
Normalization:

Ensure that the database is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
